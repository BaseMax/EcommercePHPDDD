# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) PHP 8.2 Ecommerce System

Welcome to the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) PHP 8.2 Ecommerce System! This project aims to provide a robust and scalable Restful API-based ecommerce system using PHP 8.2, all without relying on Laravel or any other third-party project. This README will guide you through the setup, architecture, and usage of the system.

## Introduction

The DDD PHP 8.2 Ecommerce System is designed with a focus on Domain-Driven Design principles. It provides a solid foundation for building a flexible and maintainable ecommerce solution, emphasizing separation of concerns and modularity.

## Features

- Domain-Driven Design: The system adheres to DDD principles, helping you create a clear and structured architecture for your ecommerce application.
- Restful API: The API is designed to be RESTful, enabling easy integration with various client applications.
- PHP 8.2: Utilize the latest features and enhancements provided by PHP 8.2 for improved performance and maintainability.
- Modular Design: The architecture promotes modularization, making it easier to add, update, or replace specific components of the system.
- Custom ORM: Implement a simple Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tailored to the needs of the ecommerce domain.

## Architecture

The architecture of the DDD PHP 8.2 Ecommerce System follows a layered approach, separating concerns and promoting a clear division of responsibilities. The main layers are:

- **Presentation Layer:** Handles user interaction, including handling HTTP requests and responses. It exposes the Restful API endpoints.
- **Application Layer:** Orchestrates the interaction between the Presentation and Domain layers. Contains application services and use cases.
- **Domain Layer:** Contains the core business logic and domain entities. This layer is the heart of the application and should be independent of other layers.
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Provides implementations for external dependencies such as databases, HTTP clients, and third-party integrations.

- Configure your web server to point to the public directory as the document root.
- Set up your database connection in the `.env` and `config/database.php` file.
- Define your domain entities, aggregates, and repositories in the Domain layer.
- Implement application services and use cases in the Application layer.
- Create Restful API endpoints in the Presentation layer using appropriate controllers and routing.
